📚 DSA Practice & LeetCode Solutions
A clean and organized collection of Data Structures, Algorithms, and LeetCode problem solutions that I've practiced. This repository is meant to track progress, maintain consistency, and help others learn from beginner to advanced concepts.

🚀 About This Repository
This repo contains:

My handwritten and practiced DSA data structure implementations (Arrays, LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, HashMap, etc.)
LeetCode problems I solved with clean, readable Java solutions
Organized folders for easy navigation
Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced DSA journey
